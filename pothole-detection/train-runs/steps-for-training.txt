# For potholes-only dataset
1. Download yolov5 models
2. Create custom .yaml file for the dataset under yolov5/data/dataset-potholes-only.yaml
3. Modify the yolo .yaml file for the model u want to use; change # of classes to 1
4. Run the train command below in the yolov5 folder
    python train.py --img 640 --batch 16 --epochs 50 --data data/dataset-potholes-only.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt
5. Training/Validation results included under runs/train folder (can see training logs, plots, etc.)
6. Automatically saves the best model weights under runs/train as best.pt
7. Can use detect.py to to use the model to perform inference (just testing purposes)
    Ex: python detect.py --weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt --img 640 --source /path/to/test/images
8. To finetune model or train on other datasets, can run the following on the best.pt model
    python train.py --img 640 --batch 16 --epochs 50 --data pothole_dataset.yaml --weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt
    (WOULD NEED TO MODIFY THE .YAML FILES TO MATCH THE NUMBER OF CLASSES AND POINT TO NEW DATASET)

Fine tuning:
- can also train a model from scratch without COCO pretrained weights
- by default, yolov5 comes out of the box trained on 80 different classes (COCO)
- can leave the weights blank to specify training from scratch (NOT RECOMMMENDED BETTER TO FINE-TUNE)
- also can use --patience 10 for auto-early stopping

NOTE: yolo expects a folder structure like below:

pothole-detection/datasets/potholes-only/
  ├── train/
  │   ├── images/   # Training images
  │   ├── labels/   # Corresponding YOLO-format labels
  ├── valid/
  │   ├── images/   # Validation images
  │   ├── labels/   # Corresponding YOLO-format labels
